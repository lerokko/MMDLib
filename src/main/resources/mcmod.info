  "description": "Fork of the original MMDLib - A library mod providing helper functionality - used by the Metals family of mods and some others. This fork only removes 2 lines of code that stops adding trades to villagers. These trades were bugged and could not be turned off in the original (Issue-53). This fork has removed that capability, the code is still executed, but the trades are no longer added.",
