# MMDLib without Villager Trades

related:https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/MMDLib/issues/53
I am forking this and not contributing to the source cause I am a noob and do not know how to fix this bug, but I also do NOT want the additional villager trades for my modpack, and I do know how to disable that part of the code. So I just removed it in my fork instead of fixing the bug. End of story.
